This is the repo of a research effort in the area of ML applied to optimization/operations research.

The file solver.py contains a branch and bound approach to the knapsack problem. 

The data that defines the knapsack problem to be solved must be in a text file with data in the following pattern:

    numberOfItems knapsackCapacity
    v1            $w_1$
    v2            w2
